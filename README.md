## Step By Step Instructions
1. Download Background image and set as Homescreen, perspective zoom turned off
2. Download all mentioned apps
3. Get my Widgy and add as medium sized widget on your homescreen
4. Put your phone into "Edit Homescreen" mode, swipe to the empty page and take a screenshot
5. Get both Scriptable scripts and run my Scriptable script once. This should prompt you through the process including the selection of the screenshot.
6. Add large Scriptable widget on your homescreen and choose the script "Random Crypto Art" as widget
7. Get icons for the apps you want to have in the dock. I manually edited their icon background in Sketch with the homescreen look, but you can also just choose other icons or e.g. a white background.
8. In Shortcuts app create separate shortcuts, which open the corresponding apps you want to display in the dock
9. "Add Shortcut to homescreen" – inside that menu you can tap on the icon and upload your own picture. In this selection you have to choose the icon you downloaded/created.
10. Place icons accordingly

<b>Enjoy!</b>
